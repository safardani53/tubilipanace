Bridgerton's esteemed families of London high society and their romantic pursuits are seen through the lens of a mysterious gossip columnist, Lady Whistledown (voiced by none other than <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Julie Andrews</a>). When the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Shonda Rhimes</a>-produced series first hit Netflix at the end of 2020, it broke records, streaming in over 82 million households during the first few weeks of its release.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>season 3</a> will take a turn from the book order and instead follow the sweet romance between Colin Bridgerton (Luke Thompson) and Penelope Featherington (Nicola Coughlan), the creative team behind Bridgerton intends to tell the story of each sibling.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It was always my goal to focus on a different Bridgerton sibling every season and it's no secret there are eight Bridgerton siblings," series creator <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Chris Van Dusen</a> told Entertainment Tonight in 2022. "We will be on as long as Netflix will have us, but I would love to focus on every single one of those eight Bridgerton siblings and tell romance stories for all of them."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The period romance is set to debut its first spinoff, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story</a>, in May. In addition to a handful of new actors, the series will see the return of Golda Rosheuval as Queen Charlotte, Adjoa Andoh as Lady Agatha Danbury and Ruth Gemmell as Lady Violet Bridgerton.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's everything to know about the cast of Bridgerton.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-reg-jean-page-as-simon-basset-duke-of-hastings></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Regé-Jean Page as Simon Basset, Duke of Hastings</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Liam Daniel/Netflix ; Steve Granitz/FilmMagic</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Duke of Hastings is brought to life by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Regé-Jean Page</a>.

Pointing to his character's entrance on a horse, he has spoken about the positive impact of racially diverse casting in period dramas like Bridgerton.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Being on a horse is literally lifting people into a position of aspiration, power, possibility and agency that they've not been afforded before," he told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>British GQ</a> in 2021. "That's what's ridiculous. That we are not creative enough in the creative industries — that's the failure. But the second you start doing that? It's like, 'This is so easy!' Yes, it is, so keep doing that."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Page, who grew up between Zimbabwe and the U.K., began acting as a child, landing his first "role" as the Little Drummer Boy in his school's nativity play. His professional debut came in 2001 playing Tanaka in Gimme 6; this was followed by roles in Waterloo Road, Roots and For the People. Since Bridgerton, he's starred in Netflix's action film The Gray Man and appeared in the 2023 film <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Dungeons & Dragons</a><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>: Honor Among Thieves</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actor is also reportedly in the running to become the next James Bond — but Page himself has kept quiet on those rumors.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's a conversation people are having, and it's terribly flattering that they're having it," he told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Vanity Fair</a> in 2023.
