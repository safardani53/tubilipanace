The family was trying to survive the great depression.</p><p>Gordie used to stuff newspapers and magazines into his socks as shin pads. Then, finally, his mother saved up money for months to buy him the first pair of skates.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/gordie-howe-young.jpg><p>With some neighborhood friends, Gordie would play tennis ball outdoors. And when the ball would freeze due to cold temperature, they used to go to the neighbor’s oven. Later, Howe’s family moved from Floral to Saskatoon.</p><p>Gordie was passionate about hockey from the age of eight-nine. Then at sixteen, he left his hometown to pursue his dream of becoming a professional hockey player.</p><h3>How did Howe Start playing Hockey?</h3><p>Howe was an academically poor student, failing the third grade twice. But the quiet kid was a heck of a hockey player. He started as a goalie, moved to defense, and then settled in at forward.</p><p>Though he was big and awkward, he could score. At 15, Howe attended the Ranger’s tryout camp in Winnipeg, but it didn’t work out.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>Here’s a short bio about <strong>Connor Clifton: NHL Career, Family, Girlfriend & Net Worth</strong>. Read it out!</a></p><p>The following year, Red Wings scout discovered him and sent him to the team’s training camp, in Ontario. Two seasons later, at the age of 18, Howe played in the NHL.&nbsp;</p><h2>Exterior Feature of Howe</h2><p>Howe had a thick neck, sloping shoulders, and firm wrist. Taking about his personality, the 6 foot 1 inch tall was also challenging and aggressive.</p><p>He was 205 pounds, making him one of the heavier players in the league. He used to throw his weight around in the game and never backed away from a fight.</p><h2>Gordie Howe: Professional Career</h2><p>In 1944, Howe was put on the Detroit Red Wings negotiating list.
