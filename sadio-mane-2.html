However, his father’s name was not mentioned anywhere because Sadio was just 7 years old when his father died.</p><p>Likewise, Sadio, at the time of his father’s death, was playing football with his friend. Later, when his friend informed him about his father, Sadio thought it was a joke.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/246E0F32-3E69-4303-B0D7-0077ACD36F96.jpeg><p>After some time, when he found that his friend wasn’t lying, Sadio couldn’t believe his father was no more. Indeed, Sadio was devastated after hearing the news.</p><p>However, Sadio Mane’s father was sick for 2-3 weeks, and he died due to a lack of proper health facilities. Sadly, there were no hospitals in Senegal at that time, or let’s say in Sadio’s locality or nearest localities.</p><p>From that time onwards, Sadio was determined to do something in his life. He felt that even though his father died, no other children should face the same problem as him.</p><p>However, Sadio couldn’t even attend school because his family’s financial condition was too low to have proper food. Sadly, the truth is school is not even a priority when you have to satisfy your hunger.</p><p>My parents never had money to send me to school. I would always play football with my friends in the streets.</p><p>Besides, football’s craze developed when his country Senegal was in the quarter-finals of the <strong>World Cup 2002</strong>. That immensely inspired Sadio. Besides, he was always interested in football.</p><p>However, Sadio came from a religious family, and it took him a long time to convince them that football could also be a career. Later, his family would sell all the crops to help him play football.</p><h2><span>Sadio Mane Career</span></h2><p>After convincing his family, he then went to the most popular football club in the town as players were required there. However, at that time, Sadio was just 15 years old.</p><p>At the time of selection, an older man was testing the players. First, the older man thought Sadio was in the wrong place; later, Sadio explained he was there for the test.</p><p>Sadio told the man that he was there to play and show them their skills, and he was wearing the best shoe and shorts he had.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Sadio-Mane-tedaching-his-favorite-skills.png><p>However, the older man allowed Sadio to play the game. To his amazement, he was not expecting Sadio to be such a great player. Later, the older man picked Sadio straight away.</p><p>After that, Sadio went to training in the local team. He was the poorest and the most gifted footballer on the team.</p><p>Finally, on January 14, 2012, Mane made his professional debut for Metz. For his first league season, he made 19 appearances, 12 as a starter, and scored a solitary goal in a 2-5 loss to Guingamp on May 4.</p><h3>Transfer To Salzburg</h3><p>In August of 2012, Sadio moved to Red Bull Salzburg, where he scored his first hat trick. However, the season ended in 2013, with the team winning the domestic double.</p><p>Besides, Mane scored 3 times in a short period of 2 minutes and 56 seconds and set a new premier record for the fastest hat trick.</p><p>Further, in January 2016, the manager dropped Mane from the starting line-up for a match after he turned up late for a pre-match meeting.</p><p>Finally, after not scoring anything for four months, Mane scores twice in a 3-2 victory over Liverpool. Not surprisingly, he also scored a hat-trick in a match against Manchester United and made his team win the match.</p><h3>Liverpool (2016-2018)</h3><p>In 2016, on June 26, Mane signs a contract with Liverpool for 5 years worth £34 million, which made him the most expensive African player in history.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/0782AADD-71D5-4DD1-9800-FBF61686822C.jpeg><p>Similarly, Mane scores his fourth goal 4-3 against Arsenal during his Premier League debut.</p><p>After being unable to play due to a shoulder injury, Mane returns to the starting up line against Burton Albion and has two assists in a 5-0 win in the League Cup.</p><p>Mane, in his first season with Liverpool, was announced as the PFA Team of the Year after scoring 13 league goals. Even after missing the latter part of the season in May of 2017, he was awarded the Season’s Player.</p><p>In 2017 at the start of the new season, Mane became Player of the Month after scoring in each of the matches.</p><p>Besides, in his match against Manchester, he was given a red card, which later resulted in a three-match ban.</p><p>However, Mane also becomes the second player in Europe to score a hat-trick after giving his first hat-trick of 2018 for Liverpool in a 5-0 away win against Porto in the UEFA Champion League’s round of 16 first leg.</p><p>Further, in 2018 Mane became the first Senegalese player to score in the final match. Similarly, Liverpool became the first team in history whose three players scored 10+ goals in a single Championship League Season.</p><h3>2019 – 2020</h3><p>In 2019, Liverpool won a UEFA Super Cup against Chelsea. Firstly, the match ended with a draw of 2-2, but later, at penalty shooting, Liverpool won the match by 5-4. Likewise, Mane was announced as the Man of the Match.</p><p>In January 2020, Mane was announced as the African Footballer of the Year, whereas after El Hadji Diouf, he is the second Senegalese player to win that award.</p><p>However, in October 2020, Mane tested COVID-19 positive. Before that, he had a match against Chelse where Liverpool won by 2-0.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Top 61 Sadio Mane Quotes></a></strong></p><h3>Premier League Playing Career</h3><table><tr><th class=season scope=col><p>Season</p></th><th class=apps scope=col>Apps (Subs)</th><th class=stat scope=col>Goals</th></tr><tbody><tr class=table><td class=season>2021/2022</td><td class=team>Liverpool</td><td class=appearances>0&nbsp;<span class=appearances--sub>(0)</span></td><td class=goals>0</td><td class="revealMore playerClubHistory__revealMoreRow playerHistoryExpand" tabindex=0 data-reveal=45-10Container><p>—</p></td></tr><tr class=table><td class=season>2020/2021</td><td class=team>Liverpool</td><td class=appearances>35&nbsp;<span class=appearances--sub>(4)</span></td><td class=goals>11</td><td class="revealMore playerClubHistory__revealMoreRow playerHistoryExpand" tabindex=0 data-reveal=42-10Container><p>—</p></td></tr><tr class=table><td class=season>2019/2020</td><td class=team>Liverpool</td><td class=appearances>35&nbsp;<span class=appearances--sub>(4)</span></td><td class=goals>18</td><td class="revealMore playerClubHistory__revealMoreRow playerHistoryExpand" tabindex=0 data-reveal=28-10Container><p>—</p></td></tr><tr class=table><td class=season>2018/2019</td><td class=team>Liverpool</td><td class=appearances>36&nbsp;<span class=appearances--sub>(1)</span></td><td class=goals>22</td><td class="revealMore playerClubHistory__revealMoreRow playerHistoryExpand" tabindex=0 data-reveal=27-10Container><p>—</p></td></tr><tr class=table><td class=season>2017/2018</td><td class=team>Liverpool</td><td class=appearances>29&nbsp;<span class=appearances--sub>(1)</span></td><td class=goals>10</td><td class="revealMore playerClubHistory__revealMoreRow playerHistoryExpand" tabindex=0 data-reveal=26-10Container><p>—</p></td></tr><tr class=table><td class=season>2016/2017</td><td class=team>Liverpool</td><td class=appearances>27&nbsp;<span class=appearances--sub>(1)</span></td><td class=goals>13</td><td class="revealMore playerClubHistory__revealMoreRow playerHistoryExpand" tabindex=0 data-reveal=25-10Container><p>—</p></td></tr><tr class=table><td class=season>2015/2016</td><td class=team>Southampton</td><td class=appearances>37&nbsp;<span class=appearances--sub>(7)</span></td><td class=goals>11</td><td class="revealMore playerClubHistory__revealMoreRow playerHistoryExpand" tabindex=0 data-reveal=24-20Container><p>—</p></td></tr><tr class=table><td class=season>2014/2015</td><td class=team>Southampton</td><td class=appearances>30&nbsp;<span class=appearances--sub>(6)</span></td><td class=goals>10</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>International Career</h3><p>In 2012, Mane played an Olympics tournament in Senegal, but they couldn’t win that match.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/418F4025-7F29-4AD7-A4D4-46A94D3365A5-1024x591.jpeg><p>Again, in 2018 Mane was in the 23-man squad for Fifa World Cup, where they played against Japan.
